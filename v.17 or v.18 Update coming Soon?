I was wondering if SPMC will see an v17.x updates anytime soon? Or will SPMC be skipping v17 all together and moving to a version of Kodi 18.x in the upcoming future?
My mine reason for asking I use an Android box called Droid Box and Droid Box uses SPMC for there custom DBMC. And I noticed that v16.x is starting to see a lot of limitations on what it can do and it is not supported by a lot of addons and builds anymore.
